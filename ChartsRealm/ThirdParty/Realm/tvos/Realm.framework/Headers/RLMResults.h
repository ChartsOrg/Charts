@class RLMObject, RLMRealm, RLMNotificationToken;

/**
 `RLMResults` is an auto-updating container type in Realm returned from object
 queries. It represents the results of the query in the form of a collection of objects.

 `RLMResults` can be queried using the same predicates as `RLMObject` and `RLMArray`,
 and you can chain queries to further filter results.

 `RLMResults` always reflect the current state of the Realm on the current thread,
 including during write transactions on the current thread. The one exception to
 this is when using `for...in` fast enumeration, which will always enumerate
 over the objects which matched the query when the enumeration is begun, even if
 some of them are deleted or modified to be excluded by the filter during the
 enumeration.

 `RLMResults` are lazily evaluated the first time they are accessed; they only
 run queries when the result of the query is requested. This means that 
 chaining several temporary `RLMResults` to sort and filter your data does not 
 perform any extra work processing the intermediate state.

 Once the results have been evaluated or a notification block has been added,
 the results are eagerly kept up-to-date, with the work done to keep them
 up-to-date done on a background thread whenever possible.

 `RLMResults` cannot be directly instantiated.

#pragma mark - Notifications

/**
 Registers a block to be called each time the results collection changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called with the initial results collection,
 and then called again after each write transaction which changes either any
 of the objects in the results, or which objects are in the results.

 The `change` parameter will be `nil` the first time the block is called.
 For each call after that, it will contain information about
 which rows in the results collection were added, removed or modified. If a
 write transaction did not modify any objects in the results collection,
 the block is not called at all. See the `RLMCollectionChange` documentation for
 information on how the changes are reported and an example of updating a 
 `UITableView`.

 If an error occurs the block will be called with `nil` for the results
 parameter and a non-`nil` error. Currently the only errors that can occur are
 when opening the Realm on the background worker thread.

 At the time when the block is called, the `RLMResults` object will be fully
 evaluated and up-to-date, and as long as you do not perform a write transaction
 on the same thread or explicitly call `-[RLMRealm refresh]`, accessing it will
 never perform blocking work.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When
 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.

     RLMResults<Dog *> *results = [Dog allObjects];
     NSLog(@"dogs.count: %zu", dogs.count); // => 0
     self.token = [results addNotificationBlock:^(RLMResults *dogs,
                                                  RLMCollectionChange *changes,
                                                  NSError *error) {
         // Only fired once for the example
         NSLog(@"dogs.count: %zu", dogs.count); // => 1
     }];
     [realm transactionWithBlock:^{
         Dog *dog = [[Dog alloc] init];
         dog.name = @"Rex";
         [realm addObject:dog];
     }];
     // end of run loop execution context

 You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to continue
 to be sent to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `-stop` on the token.

 @warning This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the
          containing Realm is read-only.

 @param block The block to be called whenever a change occurs.
 @return A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.
