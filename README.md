### Just a heads up: Charts 3.0 has some breaking changes. Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/v3.0.0). 
### Another heads up: ChartsRealm is now in a [separate repo](https://github.com/danielgindi/ChartsRealm). Pods is also now `Charts` and `ChartsRealm`, instead of ~`Charts/Core`~ and ~`Charts/Realm`~

* Xcode 8.0 / Swift 3.1
* iOS >= 8.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)
* tvOS >= 9.0
* macOS >= 10.11

Okay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, and in the meanwhile there's no decent charting solution for iOS.

I've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.

**An amazing feature** of this library now, for Android, iOS, tvOS and macOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)

## Having trouble running the demo?

* `ChartsDemo/ChartsDemo.xcodeproj` is the demo project for iOS/tvOS
* `ChartsDemo-OSX/ChartsDemo-OSX.xcodeproj` is the demo project for macOS
* Make sure you are running a supported version of Xcode.
  * Usually it is specified here a few lines above.
  * In most cases it will be the latest Xcode version.
* Make sure that your project supports Swift 3.0
* Optional: Run `carthage checkout` in the project folder, to fetch dependencies (i.e testing dependencies).
  * If you don't have Carthage - you can get it [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).


## Usage

In order to correctly compile:

1. Drag the `Charts.xcodeproj` to your project  
2. Go to your target's settings, hit the "+" under the "Embedded Binaries" section, and select the Charts.framework  
3. `@import Charts`  
4.  When using Swift in an ObjC project:
   - You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is "*YourProject-Swift.h*", so in ChartsDemo it's "*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*". Do not try to actually include "*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*" in your project :-)
   - (Xcode 8.1 and earlier) Under "Build Options", mark "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code"
   - (Xcode 8.2+) Under "Build Options", mark "Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries"
5. When using [Realm.io](https://realm.io/):
   - Note that the Realm framework is not linked with Charts - it is only there for *optional* bindings. Which means that you need to have the framework in your project, and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with Charts. We will do our best to always compile against the latest version.
   - You'll need to add `ChartsRealm` as a dependency too.

## Troubleshooting

#### Can't compile?

* Please note the difference between installing a compiled framework from CocoaPods or Carthage, and copying the source code.
* Please read the **Usage** section again.
* Search in the issues
* Try to politely ask in the issues section

#### Other problems / feature requests

* Search in the issues
* Try to politely ask in the issues section

## CocoaPods Install

Add `pod 'Charts'` to your Podfile. "Charts" is the name of the library.  
For [Realm](https://realm.io/) support, please add `pod 'ChartsRealm'` too.

**Note:** ~~`pod 'ios-charts'`~~ is not the correct library, and refers to a different project by someone else.

## Carthage Install

Charts now include Carthage prebuilt binaries.

```carthage
github "danielgindi/Charts" == 3.0.2
github "danielgindi/Charts" ~> 3.0.2
```

In order to build the binaries for a new release, use `carthage build --no-skip-current && carthage archive Charts`.

Documentation
=======
Currently there's no need for documentation for the iOS/tvOS/macOS version, as the API is **95% the same** as on Android.  
You can read the official [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) documentation here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki)

Or you can see the [**ChartsDemo**](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/tree/master/ChartsDemo) project and learn the how-tos from it.
