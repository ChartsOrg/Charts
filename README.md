* Xcode 7 / Swift 2.0
* iOS 7.0 (Drag .swift files to your project)
* iOS 8.0 / 9.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)

Okay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, and in the meanwhile there's no decent charting solution for iOS.

I've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.

**An amazing feature** of this library now, both Android and iOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)

## Usage

In order to correctly compile:

1. Drag the `Charts.xcodeproj` to your project  
2. Go to your target's settings, hit the "+" under the "Embedded Binaries" section, and select the Charts.framework  
3. **Temporary workaround**: Xcode 6.3.1 has a bug, where you have to build your project once before actually writing the `@import` line. So hit "Build" now!  
4. `@import Charts`  
5.  When using Swift in an ObjC project:
   - You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is "*YourProject-Swift.h*", so in ChartsDemo it's "*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*". Do not try to actually include "*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*" in your project :-)
   - Under "Build Options", mark "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code"


If you want to compile for iOS 7:

1. Drag the code itself (.swift files) to your project. As sadly, Swift currently does not support compiling Frameworks for iOS 7.
2. Make sure that the files are added to the Target membership.

## CocoaPods Install

Add `pod 'Charts'` to your Podfile. "Charts" is the name of the library.  
**Note:** ~~`pod 'ios-charts'`~~ is not the correct library, and refers to a different project by someone else.

## Carthage Install

Charts now include Carthage prebuilt binaries.

```carthage
github "danielgindi/ios-charts" == 2.1.6
github "danielgindi/ios-charts" ~> 2.1.6
```

In order to build the binaries for a new release, use `carthage build --no-skip-current && carthage archive Charts`.

Documentation
=======
Currently there's no need for documentation for the iOS version, as the API is **95% the same** as on Android.  
You can read the official [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) documentation here: [**Wiki**](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki)

Or you can see the [**ChartsDemo**](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts/tree/master/ChartsDemo) project and learn the how-tos from it.
